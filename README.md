# transbank-webpay-sdk-npm-server-for-expo
This project is a basic implementation of an Express server that uses Webpay Plus to handle payments and Ngrok to expose the local server to the internet. This example is designed to demonstrate how to set up and use Webpay Plus with Express, as well as how to redirect to an Expo app once the transaction is complete.
